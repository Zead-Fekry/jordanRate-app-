Managed well, a review system creates value for buyers and sellers alike. Trustworthy systems can give consumers the confidence they need to buy a relatively unknown product,For example, research by one of us (Mike) found that higher Yelp ratings lead to higher sales. This effect is greater for independent businesses, whose reputations are less well established. Reviews also create a feedback loop that provides suppliers with valuable information: For example, ratings allow Uber to remove poorly performing drivers from its service, and they can give producers of consumer goods guidance for improving their offerings.
